🚀 Completed Task 2: Movie Website Development using ReactJS! 🎬✨

I'm excited to share that I have successfully built a feature-rich Movie App using ReactJS, integrated with the OMDb API for dynamic movie data. 🔥

🛠 Key Features:
✅ Real-time Search – Users can search for movies by title 🎥
✅ Movie Listing – Fetches and displays movies dynamically 📌
✅ Detailed Movie Info – Displays title, poster, and release year 🗂️
✅ Responsive UI – Styled with CSS for a sleek and mobile-friendly design 🎨
✅ API Integration – Fetching data seamlessly from OMDb API 🌍

⚙️ Tech Stack:
💻 Frontend: ReactJS
🎨 Styling: CSS
🌐 API: OMDb API
📦 State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

It was an amazing experience implementing React best practices and learning more about API handling. Looking forward to building more exciting projects! 🚀
